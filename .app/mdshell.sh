 An interactive shell for writing Markdown documents, with
 support for embedding bash sub-shells \$() in your Markdown!

 Usage:  mdshell <path-to-file> # creates the file if it doesn't exist

 Note backtick subshells (\`\`) not supported, only \$()

 Example:   Add \$(uname) in your Markdown and the saved
            file will contain your system info.
