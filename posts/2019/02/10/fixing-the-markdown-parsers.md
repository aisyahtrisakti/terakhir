## Fixing broken markdown parsers

OK, not fixing - horrible workarounds.

The problem is this: the HTML generated by `markdown.pl`, `markdown.sh`, and even the GitHub API all fail to correctly convert code blocks (stuff encased in triple backticks) into the desired `<pre><code>` HTML elements.

So, when converting markdown to HTML, my script `create_page` now converts the triple backticks itself, and puts the `<pre><code> (your code) </code></pre>` stuff there instead.

This seems to fix broken code blocks.. But there is still another problem to tackle:

* blackslashes inside the code blocks which precede new lines leave the newlines ignored (the backslashes need to be escaped)
