## What to do after creating a post

When a post is saved, it needs to be added to the list of recent posts.

The previous post needs to be updated to have a "next post" link, which links to the newly created post.

The main index page needs to be re-generated, as it lists recents posts by default.

The post will have been added with a category field, so the category index page for the posts category needs to be updated to list the new post as well.

Probably some other stuff too..
