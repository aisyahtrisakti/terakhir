## Tags and Categories index pages

I've updated the `create_page` and `update_pages` scripts to build two new pages: `categories.html` and `tags.html`.

These are simple index pages which list all tags/categories on the site, and which live in the root directory, alongside the main `index.html` file.

I've also updated the auto-generated site header and menus to include these pages (along with the categories archive page links already in there).
