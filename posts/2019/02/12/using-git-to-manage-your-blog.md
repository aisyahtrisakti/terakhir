## Using Git to manage your blog

A console based static site generator like this one needs a console-based solution for uploading/publishing/unpublishing the generated blog pages.

The `git` command will make this easy - and even better, GitHub will host our page for us.

We just need to do a few things:

- create some nice `git` based commands for saving, reverting, publishing and unpublishing your site content
- setup a GitHub repo, create a `gh-pages` branch, and use it!

..that will get us most of the way to having a very powerful set of features for managing our blog versions and deployments. Nice.
