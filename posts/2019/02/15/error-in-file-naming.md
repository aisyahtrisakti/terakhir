## Error in file naming

I've fixed some file naming stuff, so hopefully, this post should be saved as valid markdown, html, and our custom `.mdsh` format (which allows markdown, html and embedded sub-shell commands)..

Lets test it.. Lets call the `uname` command, and we should get its *output* saved in the `.md` file, the command itself saved in the `.mdsh` file, and valid HTML in the `.html` file:

```
Linux
```

Fingers crossed...
