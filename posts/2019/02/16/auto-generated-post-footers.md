## Auto-generated post footers

I've added a new feature - a very simple one.

The "post header" containing category, time to read, author etc (see above) is now also added to the bottom of each post, above the main site footer.

This way, it will be very easy to create different layouts in CSS, by hiding/showing post info above/below the post.

It's a bit inefficient, but simple and flexible.
