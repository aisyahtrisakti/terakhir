## Adding authors pages

Author pages are now automatically generated when adding posts, in addition to the indexes already generated.

This means, that users can go to the [authors page](/mdsh/authors/index.html) to see a list of all authors who've written posts on this blog.

Clicking on the author will take you to the [list of posts they've written](/mdsh/authors/sc0ttj.html).

This should make it a little easier to find what you need on the site.

### Further Improvements

- List the authors index somewhere (in page header, or elsewhere)
- In post header/footer, make authors name clickable (go to authors page, listing all their posts)
