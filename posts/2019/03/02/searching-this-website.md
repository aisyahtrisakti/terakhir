## Searching this website

I've simplified the `assets/js/app.js` JavaScript file that is loaded in all pages by default.

The changes mean that more pages have a search box at the top, and are filterable/searchable.

The list of searchable pages include:

- homepage
- categories and tags index pages
- author pages
- monthly and yearly index pages
- archive page
